# Batch Crop Tool

An HTML5 Canvas-based tool for cropping multiple images at once. Images can be individually adjusted to use a different crop preset. Presets are stored locally in the browser.

Best for cropping many images with only a select few needing different options.

## Preset Options

- Set as default
- Name
- Width
- Height
- X-offset
- Y-offset

## Future Considerations

Originally a proof-of-concept, this got feature creep'ed to where it is now. Further development for ease-of-use features, such as drag-and-drop and multi-select, to be determined.
